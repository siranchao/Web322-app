              “Visual Studio Code is an open-source (free) streamlined code
              editor with support for development operations like debugging,
              task running and version control. It aims to provide just the
              tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and
              leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs”. Visual
              Studio Code also runs on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows operating
              systems, which will provide the class with a single unified
              environment to work in regardless of a student’s choice of laptop
              or home computer.

              A modern web browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox will
              be used regularly throughout this course. Internet Explorer 11 /
              Edge will work as well, as it supports a similar set of
              development tools, however due to it’s lack of plugins / addons
              and cross-platform support it’s not as highly recommended. All
              screenshots and development examples used throughout this course
              have been taken in Google Chrome.

              Back in 1996 the JavaScript language specification was taken to
              Ecma (European Computer Manufacturers Association) International
              to develop a formal standardized specification, which other
              browser vendors and companies could implement and expand. This
              standardized JavaScript was dubbed “ECMAScript” and specific
              vendor versions of the specification were known as “dialects”, the
              most popular of which being “JavaScript”. When we refer to
              “JavaScript” we’re really referring to a dialect of ECMAScript
              that has been implemented in the engine / runtime environment that
              is running our JavaScript formatted code. For example, this
              includes JavaScript engines like SpiderMonkey in Firefox, v8 in
              Chrome, or Chakra in Internet Explorer.
            </p>

              At it’s core, Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript
              runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. It is
              typically used for developing server-side and networking
              applications and has recently exploded as the go-to application
              framework for many real-time web applications. This is largely due
              to it’s event-driven, non-blocking I/O model which ensures that
              the main thread of execution is not kept waiting for slow I/O
              operations (ie: stopping and waiting for a database query to
              complete). Some major companies using it include Paypal, eBay,
              GoDaddy, Heroku, Microsoft, Shutterstock, Uber, Wikia just to name
              a few.

              “jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It
              makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event
              handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API
              that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of
              versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that
              millions of people write JavaScript.”
